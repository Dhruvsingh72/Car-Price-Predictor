# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts the price of used cars based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, and more. Using machine learning techniques, it helps estimate a fair market price for cars.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of car dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation
- Price prediction based on user input features

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Jupyter Notebook for development
